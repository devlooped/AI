# Notes Agent
This agent is designed to take notes based on user input. It can capture important information, summarize discussions, and organize notes for easy retrieval later. The Notes Agent can be particularly useful in meetings, brainstorming sessions, or any scenario where capturing key points is essential.

It saves these notes in JSON-LD format to the file `notes.json` alongside this agent, ensuring that the notes are structured and easily accessible for future reference.
